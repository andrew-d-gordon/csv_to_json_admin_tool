# csv_to_json_admin_tool
Python Library for parsing CSV Data and building desired Json Objects to output files.

Additional information on use case and current implementation can be found in [spec.md](docs/spec.md) and 
[design.md](docs/design.md)

This project should not be utilized in relation to solving the same coding challenge on Hatchways. This is my personal
implementation for a company assessment.
