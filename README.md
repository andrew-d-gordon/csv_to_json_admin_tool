# csv_to_json_admin_tool
Python Library for parsing CSV Data and building desired Json Objects to output files.

Additional information on use case and current implementation can be found in [spec.md](docs/spec.md) and 
[design.md](docs/design.md)

**Example run**:
`“python main.py tests/Example1/courses.csv tests/Example1/students.csv tests/Example1/tests.csv tests/Example1/marks.csv 
tests/test_outputs/output.json”`

Refer to spec.md or files in tests/Example1 to understand how csv inputs should be formatted.

**Use**:
This project should not be utilized in relation to solving the same coding challenge on Hatchways. This is my personal
implementation for a company assessment.
